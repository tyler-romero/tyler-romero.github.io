# Tyler Romero's website and blog
[tyleraromero.com](https://www.tylerromero.com/)

This website is made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nerdhaus/eleventufte/tree/main">eleventufte</a>. Custom figures are made with <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>. The combination of Tufte CSS and Excalidraw to achieve a notebook-like appearance was borrowed from <a href="https://siboehm.com/">Simon Boehm's website</a>, because having a visually appealing site helps motivate me to write.
