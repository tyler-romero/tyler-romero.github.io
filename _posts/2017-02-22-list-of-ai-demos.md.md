This is my curated list of **interesting** and **non-technical** artificial intelligence demos. I do not attempt to explain any of the concepts, but hopefully these demos help shine some light on the some of the *abilities* of Artificial Intelligence.

### Traditional Artificial Intelligence
[Perfect Tic Tac Toe](http://perfecttictactoe.herokuapp.com/)  
This tic tac toe game will always win or draw. It is a toy example of an algorithm called **minimax** that can choose the optimal action to take for any given board position. You can read a good explanation of minimax [here](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax). Minimax (with the help of some additional features) can be applied to many turn based games, such as chess, checkers, connect four, etc.

[Searching with A*](https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/)  
Ever wonder how google maps can help you find a route? It is just **searching** very quickly. The "Artificial Intelligence" in searching is that certain algorithms (like A*) use heuristics (like straight line distance to the destination) in order to greatly improve their search speed.

### Machine Learning
[Virtual Tanks Learning to Fight through a Genetic Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2t77mQmJiY)  
**Genetic Algorithms** are adaptive algorithms based on natural selection and genetics. They attempt to improve the performance of an agent on a specific task. In this case, that task is winning a battle against another "tank". Genetic algorithms can be applied to a wide variety of tasks in order to improve the ability of an artificial intelligence agent.

[Inverted Triple Pendulum / Cartpole Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyN-CRNrb3E)  
This amazing demonstration shows the power of **reinforcement learning**. Through trial and error, and with the ability to learn from its mistakes, this robot has learned to balance an inverted triple pendulum.

### Deep Learning (Neural Networks)  
[Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org)  
Hit the play button to get started! Play around with the parameters and see if you can get the **neural network** to correctly fit one of the four data distributions.

[MarI/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44&t=7s)  
This video shows how a **neural network** (in combination with a **genetic algorithm**) can learn to play Super Mario World. It plays this level like an expert. However, I suspect that its skill doesn't generalize to other levels without significant additional training.

[Doodle Guesser](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)  
An amusing web app that tries to guess what you draw. It is quite good! Its guesses are drawn from a **convolutional neural network** trained on other people's doodles. 

[Sentiment Analysis](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sentiment/rntnDemo.html)  
This demo shows how **recurrent neural networks** and **natural language processing** can be used to understand the sentiment behind sentences. Enter a sentence and see how the model parses the sentences and analyzes its sentiment.

[Pac-Man with Reinforcement Learning](https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_kpL9bSsS4GXsYb9HuEfew)  
This pac-man agent was trained to become better at pack man using **reinforcement learning** in conjunction with a **neural network**. The short demonstration of the agent in action shows that it plays near an expert human level.

### Smorgasboard
[Andrew Ng: Artificial Intelligence is the New Electricity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc)

> "Anything a typical human can do with less than one second of though we can probably now or soon automate with A.I." -- Andrew Ng (2017)
