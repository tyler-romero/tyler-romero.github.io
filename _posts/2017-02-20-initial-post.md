Hi, I'm **Tyler Romero**, and I am a Computer Scientist. I am currently working towards a Masters in Computer Science with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence** at Stanford. Welcome to my *blog* (I dislike that word, but it has no good synonym).

### Why Do I have a *Blog*?
I intend for this to be a place for me to put my thoughts about Artificial Intelligence. Whether that is discussing **progress made in A.I.**, describing **my own projects**, giving **tutorials and demos**, or whatever I want it to be.
I have comments enabled because I would like to entertain comments and questions about what I write.

A secondary motivation is that I hope to improve my technical and explanatory writing ability. Feedback on that is welcome as well.

### Plans for the future
These are the topics I plan to write about in the near future (I will update as I go):

- The ethics behind Artificial Intelligence
- A collection of demos to help a layperson understand the state of modern A.I.
- A write-up about my personal project: An AI (Deep Q-Learning) to play Atari Games
- In what ways will A.I. change society in the near future (self-driving cars to job automation)

### Smorgasboard concerning A.I.
