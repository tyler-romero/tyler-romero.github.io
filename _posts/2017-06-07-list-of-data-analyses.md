This is my curated list of data science case studies and machine learning applications that I found really cool.

[Hacker's Guide to Neural Netowrks - *Andrej Karpathy*](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)
This is a famous introduction to building and training neural networks. It discusses deep learning from the programmer's perspective.

[Dissecting Trumps Most Rabid Online Following - *Trevor Martin on FiveThirtyEight*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/)
Politics aside, this is my favorite data science application of all time. The adapted use of latent semantic analysis to allow for "subreddit algebra" is facinating and works surprisingly well.

[Human Ensemble Learning - *MLWave*](https://mlwave.com/human-ensemble-learning/)
I found this comparison of groups of humans making decisions to model ensemble predictions to be facinating.

[Safe Crime Prediction - *i am trask*](http://iamtrask.github.io/2017/06/05/homomorphic-surveillance/)
The conflict between privacy and protection is difficult to balance. This post explores how technology may be able to help using span classification as a metaphor.

[Do you work for AN investment bank, or THE investment bank? - *Todd W. Schneider*](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/do-you-work-for-an-investment-bank-or-the-investment-bank/)
An short analysis of which firms are percieved as prestigious (or maybe just well known) by the article they are assigned.

[Analyzing 1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips, with a Vengeance - *Todd W. Schneider*](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/)
An in-depth exploration of NYC's neighborhood, nightlife, and traffic. The dataset is massive, 267 GB on disk, and Todd's findings are pretty interesting.

[The Simpsons by the Data - *Todd W. Schneider*](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-simpsons-by-the-data/)
Todd really has a knack for thinking of interesting things to analyze. This is a humorous analysis of the Simpsons, taking into account dialogue and ratings.

[Mapping Ecosystems of Software Development - *Stack Overflow*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/03/mapping-ecosystems-software-development/)
A systematic analysis of tags used on Stack Overflow, and which tags tend to go together.

[Text Analysis of Trump's Tweets Confirms He Writes Only The (angrier) Android half - *Variance Explained*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/03/mapping-ecosystems-software-development/)
An analysis of Trump's tweets, based on the hypothesis that Trump tweets using an Android and his staff tweets from an iPhone.

While I'm at it, I want to plug *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* by Edward Tufte. It is a great source of interesting analyses, and, of course, a great source of advice regarding effective data visualization.
