Hi, I'm **Tyler Romero**, and I enjoy working with data. I am currently working towards a Masters in Computer Science with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence** at Stanford. Starting in August 2018, I will begin working as a **Machine Learning Scientist** for Microsoft.

This is my rather underdeveloped blog. I love learning from the data analyses and visualizations that other people come up with; some of my favorite data science blogs are [Todd Schneider's Blog](http://toddwschneider.com/archives/), [okcupid's data blog](https://theblog.okcupid.com/tagged/data), and [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/). My hope is to perform some data analyses in the same vein as these, and to post my findings here! A secondary motivation is that I hope to improve my technical and explanatory writing ability, so feedback on that is welcome as well.
