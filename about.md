This is my rather underdeveloped blog. I enjoy reading over the data analyses and visualizations that other people come up with; some of my favorites are [Todd Schneider's Blog](http://toddwschneider.com/archives/), [okcupid's data blog](https://theblog.okcupid.com/tagged/data), and [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/). My hope is to perform some data analyses in the same vein as these, and to post my findings here!

My [Resume]({{ site.url }}/resume), which is likely out of date.
