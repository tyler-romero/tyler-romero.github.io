This is my curated list of data science case studies and machine learning applications that I found really cool.

[Hacker's Guide to Neural Netowrks - *Andrej Karpathy*](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)
This is a famous introduction to building and training neural networks. It discusses deep learning from the programmer's perspective.

[Dissecting Trumps Most Rabid Online Following - *Trevor Martin on FiveThirtyEight*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/)
Politics aside, this is my favorite data science application of all time. The adapted use of latent semantic analysis to allow for "subreddit algebra" is facinating and works surprisingly well.

[Human Ensemble Learning - *MLWave*](https://mlwave.com/human-ensemble-learning/)
I found this comparison of groups of humans making decisions to model ensemble predictions to be facinating.

[Safe Crime Prediction - *i am trask*](http://iamtrask.github.io/2017/06/05/homomorphic-surveillance/)
The conflict between privacy and protection is difficult to balance. This post explores how technology may be able to help using span classification as a metaphor.

[Do you work for AN investment bank, or THE investment bank? - *Todd W. Schneider*](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/do-you-work-for-an-investment-bank-or-the-investment-bank/)
An short analysis of which firms are percieved as prestigious (or maybe just well known) by the article they are assigned.
