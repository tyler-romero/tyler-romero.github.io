*Makes 2 1/2 to 3 cups*

3 packed cups fresh Basil Leaves

2-3 large cloves Garlic

1/2 cups Walnuts[^pine-nuts]

[^pine-nuts]: Pesto is traditionally made with pine nuts, but I prefer the earthier flavor of pine nuts. Plus walnuts are less expensive.

1/2 cups Olive Oil

3/4 cups Parmesan Cheese[^parm]

[^parm]: The foodies in my life disagree but I am perfectly happy with the green bottle of Kraft Parmesan cheese.

1/2 packed cups Fresh Parsley (optional)

1/4-1/2 tsp. Salt (to taste)

Black Pepper

## Steps
1. Use a food processor to puree everything together. Its easiest to fit it all by starting with the Basil and olive oil, then adding everything else.

Can be stored for a few days in the fridge or almost indefinitely in a freezer (Thaw in a microwave on a low power setting).

This recipe is based on the Pesto recipe in the Moosewood Bible.
