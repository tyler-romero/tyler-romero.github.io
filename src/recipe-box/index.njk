        I love cooking despite being a very middle of the road home cook. I find it to be relaxing and I like that I get to actually make something in the physical world.
        I keep an old-school recipe box filled with note cards of recipes that I enjoyed making and that turned out well. So I thought
        a good way to start this page would be to describe<label for="sd-recipe-box" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sd-recipe-box" class="margin-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">With attribution provided as appropriate.</span> those recipes here the next time I decide to make them.
