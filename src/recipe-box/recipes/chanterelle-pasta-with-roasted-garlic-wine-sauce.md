This is a [lovely recipe from foragerchef](https://foragerchef.com/chef-andys-chanterelle-pasta/#recipe).

In the Pacific Northwest, chanterelles are in season in the fall. This is a great recipe to make when you have a bunch of them. Frequently they are available at farmers markets.

General tips for cooking with Mushrooms:
- Wash them by wiping with a damp paper towel immediately before use. They are like sponges and will absorb water, so don't submerge them.
- Start cooking them in dry pan and add oil after they start to stick.
- Its really hard to overcook mushrooms, so don't worry about it too much.

This recipe deviates from the general advice on how to wash mushrooms - the chanterelles are rinsed because we want them to absorb some water, which will come out in the pan sauce.
