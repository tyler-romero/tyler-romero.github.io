*Makes 2 1/2 to 3 cups*

3 packed cups fresh basil leaves<br>
2-3 large cloves garlic<br>
1/2 cups walnuts[^pine-nuts]<br>
1/2 cups olive oil<br>
3/4 cups Parmesan cheese[^parm]<br>
1/2 packed cups fresh parsley (optional)<br>
1/4 - 1/2 tsp. salt (to taste)<br>
Black pepper

[^pine-nuts]: Pesto is traditionally made with pine nuts, but I prefer the earthier flavor of walnuts. Plus walnuts are less expensive.

## Steps
1. Use a food processor to puree everything together. Its easiest to fit it all by starting with the Basil and olive oil, then adding everything else.

Can be stored for a few days in the fridge or almost indefinitely in a freezer (Thaw in a microwave on a low power setting).

This recipe is modified from the pesto recipe in [The Enchanted Broccoli Forest](https://www.molliekatzen.com/books_enchanted_broccoli.php).

[^parm]: The foodies in my life disagree but I am perfectly happy with the green bottle of Kraft Parmesan cheese.
