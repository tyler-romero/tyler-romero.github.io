1.5 tsp. granulated sugar<br>
1/2 tsp. table salt<br>
1/2 tsp (or just slightly more) baking soda

Mix all ingredients, adding the baking soda last. Cook like pancakes on a griddle at 300F, greasing the surface with butter and using english muffin rings to hold the batter. About 5 minutes on one side and 3 minutes on the other.
