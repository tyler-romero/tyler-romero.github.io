[^tjs]: Trader Joes carries everything you need for this recipe.

## Steps
1. Cut salmon into bite-sized chunks (large dice).
2. Marinate salmon in a mixture of all of the other ingredients for >1 hour.
3. Cook in an air fryer[^castiron] at 380-400Â°F for ~10-15 minutes, stirring halfway through.

[^castiron]: Could also cook in a cast iron skillet on medium heat. Cook for 3-4 minutes on one side, flip and cook 2-3 minutes on the opposite side.

Can be served with sticky rice, mayo, green onions, sesame seeds, and avocado. We also like to cook some broccolini in sesame oil as a side.
