    <h1>Hi, I'm Tyler Romero.</h1>

        </span>I am an Applied Researcher and Lead ML Engineer for <a href="https://www.groundlight.ai/">Groundlight</a>, a startup focusing on multimodal question-answering for industrial applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the recent past, I worked on large-scale recommender systems at Twitter, where I built all of the ML and ran the A/B tests behind the experimentally-successful yet sadly short-lived <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/twitter-tests-reddit-style-upvote-and-downvote-buttons/">downvote button</a>. I also researched, trained, and shipped model architecture improvements for ranking Twitter’s home timeline and conversation reply trees.

        <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml/tree/main/projects/home/recap">And some of my work at Twitter is now open-source!</a> Although the git-blame has been sanitized.</span> Before Twitter, I worked as a Research Scientist building out greenfield ML projects at Microsoft.
    </p>
    <p>
        My academic background includes a Master’s in computer science and machine learning from Stanford, and a <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2015/10/look-college-honors-outstanding-seniors.html">Bachelor’s in computer engineering</a> from Texas A&#x26;M. As an undergraduate, I performed research on novel implementations of parallel algorithms written in C / <a href="https://cilk.mit.edu/programming/">Cilk</a> and interned as a Software Engineer at Bloomberg and Microsoft.

        <input type="checkbox" id="sd-i-made-a-few" class="margin-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">I made a few contributions to Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/asset-and-investment-manager/">Asset and Investment Management</a> function and wrote Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/machine-learning/r/ref-r-olapr">a data retrieval package for R</a> that is still supported 8 years later.</span>
