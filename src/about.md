<p>Hi, I'm Tyler Romero.<span class="marginnote"><img src="/assets/img/headshop_cropped.jpg" alt="me" class="profile-picture" /></span> I am an Applied Researcher and ML Engineer for <a href="https://www.groundlight.ai/">Groundlight</a>, a startup focusing on multimodal question-answering for industrial applications.

In the recent past, I worked on large-scale recommender systems at Twitter, where I built all of the ML and ran the A/B tests behind the experimentally-successful yet sadly short-lived [downvote button](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/twitter-tests-reddit-style-upvote-and-downvote-buttons/). I also researched, trained, and shipped architecture improvements for ranking Twitter's home timeline and conversation reply trees.[^twitter] Before Twitter, I worked as a Research Scientist building out greenfield ML projects at Microsoft.

[^twitter]: [And some of my work at Twitter is now open-source!](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml/tree/main/projects/home/recap) Although the git-blame has been sanitized.

My academic background includes a Master's in computer science and machine learning from Stanford, with a [Bachelor's in computer engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2015/10/look-college-honors-outstanding-seniors.html) from Texas A&M. As an undergraduate, I performed research on novel implementations of parallel algorithms written in C / [Cilk](https://cilk.mit.edu/programming/) and interned as a Software Engineer at Bloomberg and Microsoft.[^intern]

[^intern]: I made a few contributions to Bloomberg's [Asset and Investment Management](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/asset-and-investment-manager/) function and wrote Microsoft [a data retrieval package for R](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/machine-learning/r/ref-r-olapr) that is still supported 8 years later.

## Recommendations
* [sibohem](https://siboehm.com/): An excellent ML engineering blog by Simon Boehm, and a large part of the inspiration for this site. I especially recommend Simon's posts on [optimizing multidimensional matrix multiplication on CPU](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/Fast-MMM-on-CPU) and [pipeline parallelism for distributed training](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/pipeline-parallel-training).
* [I Don't Like Notebooks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI) by Joel Grus: A humorous tour of the good, the bad, and the ugly of Jupyter Notebooks.
