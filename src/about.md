I'm Tyler Romero[^me]. I am an Applied Researcher and ML Engineer for [Groundlight](https://www.groundlight.ai/), a startup focusing on multimodal question-answering for industrial applications.

In the past, I have worked on recommender systems at Twitter[^twitter] and on bootstrapping green-field ML projects at Microsoft. Before that, I studied Computer Science and Machine Learning at Stanford.

[^twitter]: [And some of my work at Twitter is now open-source!](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml/tree/main/projects/home/recap) Although The git-blame has been wiped clean. I also built all of the ML and ran the A/B tests behind the experimentally-successful yet sadly short-lived [Downvote button](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/twitter-tests-reddit-style-upvote-and-downvote-buttons/).
